There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# Start coding here...\n# Add as many cells as you like...","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":28,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n\n# Start coding here...\n# Add as many cells as you like...","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1756703633888,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":550,"type":"dataFrame","tableState":{"customFilter":{"const":{"type":"boolean","valid":true,"value":true},"id":"9b95546b-0a75-45a3-9e88-90e292948994","nodeType":"const"}}}},"lastExecutedByKernel":"76cfb9e4-f2d3-4d95-8683-c74d15a9a2af"},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":142,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"school_name","type":"string"},{"name":"borough","type":"string"},{"name":"building_code","type":"string"},{"name":"average_math","type":"integer"},{"name":"average_reading","type":"integer"},{"name":"average_writing","type":"integer"},{"name":"percent_tested","type":"number"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0,1,2,3,4],"school_name":["New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math High School","Essex Street Academy","Lower Manhattan Arts Academy","High School for Dual Language and Asian Studies","Henry Street School for International Studies"],"borough":["Manhattan","Manhattan","Manhattan","Manhattan","Manhattan"],"building_code":["M022","M445","M445","M445","M056"],"average_math":[657,395,418,613,410],"average_reading":[601,411,428,453,406],"average_writing":[601,387,415,463,381],"percent_tested":[null,78.9,65.1,95.9,59.7]}},"total_rows":5,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"                                         school_name  ... percent_tested\n0  New Explorations into Science, Technology and ...  ...
